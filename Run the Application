Notes
The model is trained on the CIFAR-10 dataset, which contains 10 classes of objects. For better accuracy with real-world images, you might want to train on a larger dataset.

The web interface is simple but functional. You can enhance it with more features as needed.

For production deployment, consider using a WSGI server like Gunicorn and set up proper error handling.
